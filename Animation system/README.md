# It's Animation Rendering System.
In that project I realized technologies like:
1. OpenGL.
2. Classes: animation, window, math library (vectors, matrixes, camera), stock system.
3. Unit system: timer, control and input.
4. Resourses: models, textures, materials and sounds.
5. Shaders.

## How to use:
You need to download this repository to your pc, download opengl libraries on your computer and run.
If you want to create your animation, you can create file like "ctrl.h" or "test.h", then you need to include your "file_name.h" in "main.cpp" and this string add "Klass.Units.Add(new mk5::\*NAME OF YOUR CLASS in file_name.h\*);" in "main.cpp". It's needed to include your in stock of units.
